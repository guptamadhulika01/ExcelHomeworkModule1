Analysis with Excel
Project Overview: to figure out which / what type of fundraisers are able to reach out to people and have been successful in finding funding over and above there limites. Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome. 
Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. 
Objective:

Using the Excel table provided, modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects as you attempt to uncover some market trends.  Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the `state` column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live. Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the `Percent Funded` column using a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 and be a dark shade of red, transitioning to green at 100, and blue at 200. Create a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent Category . 

* Create a new sheet with 8 columns:

  * `Goal`
  * `Number Successful`
  * `Number Failed`
  * `Number Canceled`
  * `Total Projects`
  * `Percentage Successful`
  * `Percentage Failed`
  * `Percentage Canceled`

* In the `Goal` column, create 12 rows with the following headers:

  * Less than 1000
  * 1000 to 4999
  * 5000 to 9999
  * 10000 to 14999
  * 15000 to 19999
  * 20000 to 24999
  * 25000 to 29999
  * 30000 to 34999
  * 35000 to 39999
  * 40000 to 44999
  * 45000 to 49999
  * Greater than or equal to 50000
